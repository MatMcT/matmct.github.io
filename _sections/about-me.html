I'm a Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for all things robotics. My broad skillset has seen
me take on many different projects across different fields. I specialise in custom integration from low-level hardware/firmware to higher-level complex robotics systems. I love hands on work and not afraid to jump into the deep end if need.
</p>

<p>My core skills include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li> 3D design in CAD software such as Solidworks and Fusion 360</li>
    <li> High quality drawings suitable for production.</li>
    <li> Firmware design in 8 and 32 bit chipsets. Particularly Atmel and STM</li>
    <li> High reliability firmware design</li>
    <li> C, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML and ability to rapidly adapt to other languages</li>
    <li> Simple UI design</li>
    <li> Containerisation of software systems (Docker)</li>
    <li> Version control (GIT)</li>
    <li> Robot Operation System (ROS)</li>
</ul>

<p>My interests include:</p>
