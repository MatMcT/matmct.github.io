I'm a Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for all things robotics. My broad skillset has seen
me take on many different projects across different fields. I specialise in custom integration from low-level hardware/firmware to higher-level complex robotics systems. I love hands on work and not afraid to jump into the deep end if need.

#### My core skills include:

- 3D design in CAD software such as Solidworks and Fusion 360
- High quality drawings suitable for production.
- Firmware design in 8 and 32 bit chipsets. Particularly Atmel and STM
- C, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML and ability to rapidly adapt to other languages
- Simple UI design
- Containerisation of software systems (Docker)
- Version control (GIT)
- Robot Operation System (ROS)

#### My interests include:

- Machine Learning
- Robotics
- Military Robotics
